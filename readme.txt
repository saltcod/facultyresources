A new base theme. Very largely based on victoria_park, the barebones, HTML5 theme from Automattic (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/victoria_park).

This theme aims to aleviate some of the startup work involved in using victoria_park. It sets some sensible defaults, removes the comments template, and outlines the major areas—primary, secondary, main, articles, headers, footers, etc.

Pages are structured thusly: 

— body
— header#branding
— nav
— main
— primary  
  — content
  — article
— secondary
— footer#colophon
